/**
 * insert_node - Inserts a new node with a given number into a sorted singly linked list.
 * @head: A double pointer to the head of the linked list, allowing modification of the list's head.
 * @number: The integer value to be stored in the new node and inserted into the list.
 *
 * Description: This function creates a new node with the specified number and inserts it into the
 *              correct position in the linked list, maintaining the list's sorted order. If the list
 *              is empty or the new node should be inserted before the current head, the new node becomes
 *              the new head. Otherwise, it is inserted in the appropriate position within the list.
 *
 * Return: Address of the newly created node if the insertion is successful; otherwise, returns NULL
 *         if memory allocation fails.
